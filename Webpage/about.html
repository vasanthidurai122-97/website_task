      <p>We are a team of passionate developers providing training in modern web technologies.
        This is a simplistic course description and rather open-ended, but there is a reason for that. There are many types of online courses that target a variety of levels of competence and types of customers/employees. 
        For example, a general interest course on ‘how to knit a jumper’ 
        will probably not have the same course description format, tone, and writing style as an online degree program from a 
recognized institution of higher education, but they will have similar types of information.
